#### What I have learned in this week:

**Describe briefly what you have learned this week, with a brief explanation of what you have learned.**

Cause I have been studying java for a while, so the most I learned was Git and GitHub. Before I just heared about GitHub but never used it. And I remember git is the content in Linux, but I just learned a little of Linux, so it is also a new piece of knowledge to me. I learn from them by configuring the Git Bash, include linking local and remote repertories, cloning remote repertories, submitting Pull Request and so on.

#### Difficult for me in this week

**Describe briefly the difficulties you encountered in your studies this week and how you solved them.**

To be honest, I met plenty of difficulties in my learning process. First, it is difficult for me to read English documents, especially the git part cause I have not learned it before. Luckily someone in the QQ group sent a simple Chinese guideline, so I could learn it easier. Secondly, I found that some steps in the English documents which I couldn't finish. I guess probably because I am not a student in UC Berkeley (I don't know if I am right). And finally when I wanted to clone your repertories to write this summary, I found that I couldn't clone successfully and the error is "invalid path". So I seek for solutions on the Stack Overflow and I resolved it by running "git config core.protectNTFS false" though I don't know why.

#### About HW

**Describe the completion of the assignment, attaching the part of the code you are satisfied with.**

You said we don't need to finish homework this week so I just finish the lab. The lab is easy, but I can't pass the   ChecklabConfig. My guess has already been said above. But I could still submit it to Gradescope, so I think it is not a 
big problem.
#### Feedback

**Feedback on this week's GUIDE and how you think the GUIDE can still be optimized.**

I think the git part might be difficult for beginners (especially for English rookies), and using the Chinese guideline in the QQ group together may be better for them (including me XD).
