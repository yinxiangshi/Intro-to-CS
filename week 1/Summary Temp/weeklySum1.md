#### Weekly Summary 1

##### What I have learned in this week:

* Basic theory and simple command of git.

I've learned basic and general git workflow through pulling skeleton code of lab1 in CS61B-21sp from remote repository to my local work directory with the tutorial `从0开始的CS61b生活`. 

Also I read `Git basic and general git workflow` to reach a complete  view of how git plays a significant role in the work of  development (version control, distribution and teamwork) though I can't practice with version 22-sp since it's not released. 

Besides I find it visualized to learn some commands and philosophy of git branching in this interactive page: [learn git branching](https://oschina.gitee.io/learn-git-branching/), which is helpful for me to understand and practice. 

* WSL installed & configuration for CLI practice

Before reading guide/`cisdiy.wiki`and knowing existence of WSL I use a remote cloudserver rent from Tencent for linux development due to weak functionality of my computer which will be stuck running on vmware. This weekend I install WSL and  proceed some fundamental configuration. Though I've learned a teeny-weeny knowledge in CLI before, this time hope I can really learn how to work effectively in command line terminal. 

* CS61B part: Java basics and data structure

Introduction to  java basics in cs61b is pretty straightforward and easily understood. I've learned java course in shcool last term but I never concentrate and write codes as requirement so I inspect elements and features in java again, through learning the slides of lecture 1-5 and leading of  `Head First Java` first two chapter. 

Details worth mentioning is that ways of comment in java is a part I ignore.

Besides, I simply review Array and List these two fundamental data structure by lecture 4 and 5 (version 22sp). 

##### Difficult for me in this week

* at the beginning of learning git, I kind of lost in some miscellaneous details when reading officail manul (e.g. confused about some options after commands or dwell on concepts in description), partly because I start with the flow of cs61b-22sp and it isn't released so I can't establish a in-depth understanding in it by using it. But then I work with the version-21 guide and other visualized tools to fix this issue.
* spend some time in  deeply understanding some details in knowledge in lecture 5 ( e.g.  multidimensional arrays in java). 

* In sum, it seems not so much tricky issue encountered  in first week. 

##### About lab and homework

homework in sp22 has not been released so I have just done lab1 in sp21, and there are not so much code to be written and mainly configuration of developing environment.

Besides hw0:basic java programs aims at normalizing some syntax and convention in java for next journey of course.

##### Feedback

prior issue is about whether follow the version-18 or the version21 (or version 22). 

Besides, there's a lot content in setup guide (csb61 lab) is only for students of UCB and sometimes I get confused about this content and I really can't tell if I am able to perform certain task in setup or it's something anyone can do.

maybe more introduction to details about this courese.

**then finally, really appreciate to all these tough work which 处长 contribute to in busy schedule. **
