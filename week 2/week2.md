Thanks for your guys’ feedback, in this week, I will fix all the issue that mentioned before.

#### CS61B:

In this week, we will continue learning CS61B (SP22)

[Developing a Sort, Unit Testing](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/materials/lectures/lect6.pdf)

[Object-Based Programming](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/materials/lectures/lect7.pdf)

[Object-oriented Mechanisms](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/materials/lectures/lect8.pdf)

[Interfaces and Abstract Classes](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/materials/lectures/lect9.pdf)

###### For the people that really have issues in learning java:

[Java key summary(in Chinese)](https://cyw3.github.io/YalesonChan/2016/Java-key.html): Notice, you don’t need to remember all these concepts, just understand it when you meet it.

[Java generics tutor(in Chinese)](https://blog.csdn.net/s10461/article/details/53941091)

###### If you are done well with java, here is some supplements that might useful for you to read:

For sorting algo: [cmu advanced lecture](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs200/Spring15/slides/09-advSort.pdf)

For JUNIT Test: [vogella](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JUnit/article.html)

[Priniples of object oriented programming design](http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~cs3443/notes/designPrinciples/designPrinciples.html)

Here are some basis lc problems, for beginners, don’t aware to try to solve these questions, just take a try, don’t need to solve all of these questions.

Basis leetcode problem: [1859. Sorting the Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/sorting-the-sentence/), [2089. Find Target Indices After Sorting Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-target-indices-after-sorting-array/), [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/), [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/), [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/).

#### This week’s HW:

After checking we will use sp18’s hw resources.

[skeleton code](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp18)

We will finish [proj 1A](https://sp18.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj1a/proj1a)
